# CS132-power-set-program-and-command-line-editor
My second coursework for CS132 (Computer Organistion and Architecture). Where we had to get the power set of any set inputted in a program and make a command line editor in C.

# Powerset
Insert the elements you want when prompted, and put a , between each element. 
otherwise they will be treated as one element

# Command line editor
Commands available:

create - Creates a file and overwrites the file if it exists

copy – Copies the content of a file to another

delete – Deletes a file 

show – Reads the content of a file

append – Adds a line at the end of the file

deleteLine – Deletes a line of the user choice from a file

insertLine – Inserts a line of the user choice to a file in whichever line they want

showLine – Read a single line from a file

list – List all the contents of the current folder including (includes hidden files and directories)

find – Finds the first occurrence of a word in a file

exit – Closes the program


Commands are case sensitive and need to be written exactly as stated. 
They can also be chained together, 
for example you can have ```./a create show list insertLine exit ``` 
This will create a file then read a file then list all the files in the current directory 
then insert line to a file and then exits the program. 

# Important note
This code was added here to show my skill of using the C programming language and logical thinking. You are NOT allowed to copy this code for any coursework/graded material unless your direct teachers EXPLICITLY agree to it, if they do you will still have to reference it, if so refer to me as 'Zeyada I.' , and link the github page.
